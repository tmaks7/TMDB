# TMDB
A practical data analysis project using SQLite and Jupyter Notebook to explore The Movie Database (TMDb)


## 🎬 The Movie Database (TMDb) Analysis Project
Welcome to my TMDb Movie & TV Show Database Analysis Project - developed as part of my **ALX Data Science class**.

---

This project explores The Movie Database (TMDb) — an online, crowd-sourced movie and TV show database that provides detailed information about some of the world’s most popular titles at your fingertips. The TMDb platform supports 39 official languages, is used in over 180 countries daily, and dates back to 2008.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Connect a serverless SQLite database using DB Browser for SQLite

Perform powerful SQL queries to answer real-world questions about movies and TV shows

Analyze movie genres, keywords, award trends, cast information, and more

Integrate SQL with Jupyter Notebook for easy, interactive data exploration

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
**DB Browser for SQLite** — to store and manage the TMDb dataset locally

**Jupyter Notebook** — for writing, running, and documenting SQL queries in an interactive environment

**SQL** — to run queries for extracting insights

**Magic commands** — a feature of the IPython kernel that let you run useful shortcuts or system tasks inside Python code cells

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
This project is a practical example of combining SQL, SQLite, and Jupyter Notebook for movie data exploration ideal for beginner to intermediate data analysts, aspiring data scientists, or anyone curious about the entertainment industry.
